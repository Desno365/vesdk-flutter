# Flutter plugin for VideoEditor SDK

## System requirements

- Flutter: 1.20.0
- Dart: 2.12.0
- iOS: 13
- Android: 5 (SDK 21)

## Getting started

Add the plugin package to the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project:

```yaml
dependencies:
  video_editor_sdk: ^3.1.0
```

Install the new dependency:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

### Android

1. Add the IMG.LY repository and plugin by opening the `android/build.gradle` file (**not** `android/app/build.gradle`) and changing the following block:

   ```diff
   buildscript {
   -   ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50'
   +   ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.21'
       repositories {
           ...
           mavenCentral()
   +       maven { url "https://artifactory.img.ly/artifactory/imgly" }
           ...
       }
       dependencies {
           ...
   +       classpath 'com.google.devtools.ksp:com.google.devtools.ksp.gradle.plugin:1.7.21-1.0.8' // Depending on your `kotlin_version` version.
   +       classpath 'ly.img.android.sdk:plugin:10.9.0'
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

   The KSP version depends on the Kotlin version that you are using. In order to find the correct version, please visit the [official KSP release page](https://github.com/google/ksp/releases?page=1).

   In order to update VideoEditor SDK for Android replace the version string `10.9.0` with a [newer release](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-android-demo/releases).

2. Still in the `android/build.gradle` file (**not** `android/app/build.gradle`), add these lines at the bottom:

   ```groovy
   allprojects {
       repositories {
           maven { url 'https://artifactory.img.ly/artifactory/imgly' }
       }
   }
   ```

3. In the `android/app/build.gradle` file (**not** `android/build.gradle`) you will need to modify the `minSdkVersion` to at least `21` depending on the version of Flutter that you are using. We also recommend to update the `buildToolsVersion` to `34.0.0` as well as the `compileSdkVersion` to `34`:

   ```diff
   android {
   -   compileSdkVersion flutter.compileSdkVersion
   +   compileSdkVersion 34
   +   buildToolsVersion "34.0.0"
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
   -       minSdkVersion flutter.minSdkVersion
   +       minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

   Depending on your **stable** Flutter SDK version (<= `2.5.0`), your `android/app/build.gradle` file might look a bit different. In this case, please modify it in the following way:

   ```diff
   android {
   -   compileSdkVersion 30
   +   compileSdkVersion 34
   +   buildToolsVersion "34.0.0"
       ...
       defaultConfig {
           ...
   -       minSdkVersion 16
   +       minSdkVersion 21
           ...
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

4. In the same file, configure VideoEditor SDK for Android by adding the following lines under `apply plugin: "com.android.application"`:

   ```groovy
   apply plugin: 'ly.img.android.sdk'
   apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'

   // Comment out the modules you don't need, to save size.
   IMGLY.configure {
       modules {
           include 'ui:text'
           include 'ui:focus'
           include 'ui:frame'
           include 'ui:brush'
           include 'ui:filter'
           include 'ui:sticker'
           include 'ui:overlay'
           include 'ui:transform'
           include 'ui:adjustment'
           include 'ui:text-design'
           include 'ui:video-trim'
           include 'ui:video-library'
           include 'ui:video-composition'
           include 'ui:audio-composition'
           include 'ui:giphy-sticker'

           // This module is big, remove the serializer if you don't need that feature.
           include 'backend:serializer'

           // Remove the asset packs you don't need, these are also big in size.
           include 'assets:font-basic'
           include 'assets:frame-basic'
           include 'assets:filter-basic'
           include 'assets:overlay-basic'
           include 'assets:sticker-shapes'
           include 'assets:sticker-emoticons'
           include 'assets:sticker-animated'

           include 'backend:sticker-animated'
           include 'backend:sticker-smart'
           include 'backend:background-removal'
       }
   }
   ```

### Usage

Import the packages in your `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:video_editor_sdk/video_editor_sdk.dart';
import 'package:imgly_sdk/imgly_sdk.dart';
```

Each platform requires a separate license file. [Unlock VideoEditor SDK](./lib/video_editor_sdk.dart#L13-L22) with a single line of code for both platforms via platform-specific file extensions.

Rename your license files:

- Android license: `vesdk_license.android`
- iOS license: `vesdk_license.ios`

Pass the file path without the extension to the `unlockWithLicense` function to unlock both iOS and Android:

```dart
VESDK.unlockWithLicense("assets/vesdk_license");
```

Open the editor with a video:

```dart
VESDK.openEditor(Video("assets/video.mp4"));
```

Please see the [API documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/video_editor_sdk) for more details and additional [customization and configuration options](https://pub.dev/documentation/imgly_sdk).
